# brackets-assignment

This is a simple assignment for pagination, fetching api and displaying the data including search.

I was quite hesitant to submit this as I didn't have much time to work on it due to bachelor state exam I am having on 13.6, but I thought it would be a good idea to show at least some of my current skills and how I work with the tools I'm familiar with.

Tools used:
- Vue 3
- Vite
- Tailwind
- TypeScript

What was not done:
- Filtering by some attribute, only search was implemented
- Tests
- Animations would be nice...

## Project setup
